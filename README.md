# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository to setup a new user account.
It contains any files needed to jump-start the user profile.

## Prerequisites

For the installation you really only need:

- GNU stow

But for all steps in the installation script to succeed you should also install:

- neovim
- tmux

For all neovim plugins to run you will need:

- java-environment
- nodejs
- npm
- rust
- go

## Install

For installation just clone the repository and run `install.sh`.
This will symlink any needed files to your home directory.

**Attention: This is tested on Arch linux and macOS (Apple silicon) and may not work on other OSes**
